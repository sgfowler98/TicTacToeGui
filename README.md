# TicTacToeGui
Program created for my CPSC2150 (Introduction to Software Development) class
Variable size tic-tac-toe board with GUI and variable markers in a row to win
IGameBoard.java - contracts, but not code, written by me
TicTacToeGame.java - mostly provided, only change required was which interface implementation we chose to use (previous HW assignment had us create two implementations and this one had us just pick one to use)
TicTacToeView.java - totally provided
All other code not written by myself will be marked
